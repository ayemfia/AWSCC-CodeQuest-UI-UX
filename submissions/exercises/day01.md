#### 1. UI and UX analyses for Day 1

_(just choose the questions you would like to answer and make it concise)_
<br/><br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**User-Experience Analysis:**<br/>

-   Which website is easier to find the product you are looking for?<br/>
    <p style="color:Tomato;">Answer: Between Shopee and Lazada, Lazada is easier to use when finding the product I wanted. Given a situation that I wanted to buy shoes, Lazada has a better filter than Shopee. It has a filter for my prefered shoe size and it will only show me shoes that has that shoe size. This feauture is not available in Shopee and this made me like Lazada more than Shopee in this aspect.</p>

-   Identify any distractions or unnecessary elements that could potentially confuse users.<br/>
    <p style="color:Tomato;">Answer: The pop-ups that appear on Shopee may confuse new users. It distracts me and new user may also find it distracting and annoying especially when it appears everytime the page is loaded.</p>

-   Compare the organization of content between the two platforms. Which between the two platformsâ€™ content is easier to scan and understand?<br/>
    <p style="color:Tomato;">Answer: If we talk about scanning the products, Lazada is much more simpler thus new users will find it easier to find the products they want. Shopee has a lot on their homepage that can be confusing even for me as a regular user of the app.</p>

<br/> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**User-Interface Analysis:**

-   Is the websitesâ€™ layout and design visually pleasing and consistent with their brand?<br/>
    <p style="color:Tomato;">Answer:Both have different approach in presenting their products. When an item is presented, Shopee has a bigger picture but Lazada has a smaller one. However, even if the Lazada one is smaller, the image is zoomed in if mouse is hover over the image.</p>
    
-   Comment on the responsiveness of both websites across different devices.<br/>
    <p style="color:Tomato;">Answer:Both are good and I do not ahve any problems so far.</p>
    
-   Which do you think is better when it comes to the visual aspect of the website?<br/>
    <p style="color:Tomato;">Answer: Talking about the visual aspect, Shopee is better than Lazada. The font and colors used in Shopee is much better than Lazada. Lazada doesn't appeal that much to me and the color used doesn't emphasize the products. On the other hand, Shopee has a better way of advertising the products. In addition, the Log In and Sign Up in Lazada is not easy to find.</p>
